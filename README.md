Face Mask Detection System built by Keras/TensorFlow, Deep Learning and Computer Vision concepts
COVID Face Mask Detection

In this project I have used neural networks from deep learning to detect mask in a picture with the help of frameworks like tensorflow, keras, sklearn, matplotlib etc.
I have also took help from others and from internet to get the model working in a video stream by looping the code for a picture for each frame of the video.
Dataset:
I have used my custom dataset by collection pictures from the 
internet of masked and unmasked people and took pictures from 
some other small datasets. So, there are variety of pictures in the 
dataset.
I have used 3000 images of people with mask on them and also
3000 pictures of people without mask.

#With Mask:
<img src="mask image.png" height="185" width="185" style="border-radius:3px;border:solid 1px #666" />
